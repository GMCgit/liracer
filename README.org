* liracer
The free and open source code racing game.

** License
The project is licensed under AGPLV3, but I preserve the right to change the license at will. I have no plans of making it proprietary, but I may change the FLOSS license as I see fit.

** Contribute
The easiest way to contribute is to submit a code quote. The quotes are stored in [[https://github.com/olav35/liracer/tree/master/models/quotes][models/quotes/<language>]]. The code quotes need to fullfil the following requirements.
- Be permissively licensed.
- Be well written.
- Be moderately short.
For a start you can translate an already existing quote to a new language.

**Rewrite**
A complete rewrite is in progress at [[https://github.com/olav35/liracer-rewrite]]. So far this is only a mock UI, so most contributions still belong in this repository.
