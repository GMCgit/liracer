This is a game where you compete to write source code quotes as fast as possible

** License
The project is licensed under AGPLV3, but I preserve the right to change the license at will

** Contribute
The easiest way to contribute is to submit a code quote. The quotes are stored in [[https://github.com/olav35/liracer/tree/master/models/quotes][models/quotes/<language>]]. The code quotes need to fullfil the following requirements.
- Be permissively licensed.
- Be well written.
- Be moderately short.
For a start you can translate an already existing quote to another language.
