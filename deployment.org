* Deployment
For deployment I use Heroku and GitHub Pages. Seeing as it is a monorepository the process of deployment slightly different than the normal =git push heroku master= although not by a lot.

To deploy run the following commands in the root of the repository.
** Backend
#+begin_src sh
git subtree push --prefix back heroku master
#+end_src

** Frontend
#+begin_src sh
git subtree push --prefix front/build/ origin gh-pages
#+end_src
