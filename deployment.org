* Deployment
liracer is deployed to Heroku. Seeing as it is a monorepository the process of deployment slightly different than the normal =git push heroku master= although not by a lot.

To deploy the backend run the following command in the root directory of the repository.
#+begin_src sh
git subtree push --prefix back heroku master
#+end_src
